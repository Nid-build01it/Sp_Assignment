        This little project is my take on a clean, responsive web app using <strong>Next.js</strong> (yep, the fancy one) with pure CSS. No libraries, no shortcutsâ€”just code and caffeine.

        Feel free to explore the navbarâ€”itâ€™s got dropdowns, dark mode, and all the frontend drama you'd expect. Perfect for assignments, but hey, I made sure it doesn't look boring.
